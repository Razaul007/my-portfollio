      <h2 className="text-3xl text-center font-bold">About Me</h2>
      <p className="mt-4">Hi, I’m <span className="text-xl font-bold">Razaul Alam</span>, a passionate and detail-oriented MERN Stack Web Developer with a love for turning ideas into functional, elegant, and user-friendly digital experiences. With a strong foundation in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, I thrive on building scalable web applications that solve real-world problems and delight users.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how technology works and a desire to create. Over time, I’ve honed my skills in both frontend and backend development, allowing me to craft seamless, full-stack solutions. Whether it’s designing intuitive user interfaces, optimizing database performance, or building robust APIs, I enjoy every step of the development process.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">What drives me is the opportunity to innovate and make an impact. I’m constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me brainstorming new project ideas, contributing to open-source communities, or enjoying a good cup of coffee while debugging (because let’s be honest, that’s where the magic happens).</p>
      <p className="mt-4">I believe that great code is more than just functional—it’s clean, maintainable, and built with purpose. I’m excited to collaborate, create, and bring your ideas to life. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
      <p>Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and discuss how we can work together to create something extraordinary.</p>
